Analysis of ice-associated seal abundance from 2016 aerial surveys in the Chukchi Sea

This repository includes code to format seal data from internal NOAA databases and to run abundance analyses. We will
update this repository with aggregated seal counts and other data when we get closer to submitting the associated manuscript
for publication.
